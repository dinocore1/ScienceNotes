# X-Ray Notes

## Interaction With Matter
There are 6 diffrent interactions the x-ray photon can have with matter. They are:

 * No Interaction
 * Rayleigh/Coherent Scattering
 * Compton Scattering
 * Photoelectric Absorption
 * Pair Production
 * Photodisintegration

## Beer-Lambert law ###

$$
\frac{I(x)}{I_o} = e^{- \mu x}
$$

$$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}  $$
Where $hc$ is "Planks Constant"
